# RideShare: A C++ Carpooling System

## Overview

RideShare is a robust, object-oriented C++ application that simulates a carpooling system. This project showcases strong software engineering principles, including object-oriented design, data structures, and algorithm implementation.

## Key Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes inheritance with a base `Person` class and derived `Driver` and `Passenger` classes.
- **Dynamic Data Management**: Employs vectors for efficient storage and manipulation of driver and passenger data.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Features a ride-matching algorithm based on origin, destination, and available seats.
- **User Interface**: Provides an interactive command-line interface for both drivers and passengers.
- **Input Validation**: Implements basic input validation to enhance robustness.

## Technical Highlights

- **C++ Standard Library**: Leverages `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, and `<string>` for efficient data handling.
- **Polymorphism**: Demonstrates use of virtual functions for extensibility.
- **Const Correctness**: Ensures data integrity with proper use of const member functions.
- **STL Algorithms**: Utilizes `std::transform` and `std::find` for data processing.

## Code Structure

- `Person`: Base class for common attributes and methods.
- `Driver`: Derived class with driver-specific functionality.
- `Passenger`: Derived class for passenger-specific data and methods.
- `getLocationIndex`: Utility function for location management.
- `main()`: Core logic for user interaction and ride matching.

## Potential for Expansion

This project serves as a solid foundation for a more complex ride-sharing application. Potential areas for expansion include:

- Database integration for persistent storage
- GUI development
- Payment system integration
- Real-time location tracking
- Advanced matching algorithms

## Why This Project Stands Out

1. **Clean, Readable Code**: Follows best practices in C++ coding standards.
2. **Scalable Architecture**: Designed with extensibility in mind.
3. **Real-World Application**: Addresses a practical problem in transportation.
4. **Algorithmic Thinking**: Demonstrates ability to implement complex logic.
5. **Object-Oriented Principles**: Showcases understanding of OOP concepts.
